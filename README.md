# BMI Calculator tool

A simple React application that calculates the body mass index, or BMI, which is used to determine whether you are in a healthy weight range for your height and gender.

It is useful to consider BMI alongside waist circumference, as waist measurement helps to assess risk by measuring the amount of fat carried around your middle.
